# akeum-compiler-c
akeum (악음) is my attempt at reviving Choon, a Turing complete esoteric programming language made by Stephen Sykes back in 2002.  

In the words of the original creator himself, he describes the language as:

> Choon's output is music - you can listen to it. And Choon gets away without having any conventional variable storage by
> being able to access any note that has been played on its output. One feature of musical performance is that once you have
> played a note then that's it, it's gone, you can't change it. And it's the same in Choon. Every value is a musical note,
> and every time a value is encountered in a Choon program it is played immediately on the output.
